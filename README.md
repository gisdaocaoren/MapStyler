# MapStyler

This is a simple little web app that you can use to style the tiles used
in your [ArcGIS JavaScript] applications.

So far it only works in Chrome, because that's just the way it is.
I'm planning on cleaning up the CSS of the app and set it up to so a
user can add their own mapservice urls.

Here is a [demo] of this application in action.
